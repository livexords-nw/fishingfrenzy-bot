## üì• Installation Steps

### Main Bot Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/livexords-nw/fishingfrenzy-bot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

   ```bash
   cd fishingfrenzy-bot
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Your Query**

   **For Main Bot (`query.txt`)**  
   Create a file named `query.txt` and add your query data. This file supports both token-based and guest logins.

   **Token Login Example:**  
   To use token login, open your browser, navigate to the Fishing Frenzy login page, and inspect the **Application** tab. Then, go to **Local Storage** and find the `fishauth` value. Copy it and use the following format:

   ```text
   auth_token|token
   1234567890abcdef|token
   0987654321fedcba|token
   ```

   **Guest Login Example:**

   ```text
   7fa317a4-0706-491b-aff4-ad2c53146018|guest
   1c1ee4be-73a7-4d54-8500-91af7ecbcedd|guest
   ```

   _Tutorial:_  
   Check out the image below for a step-by-step guide on obtaining your token from local storage:

5. **Set Up Proxies (Mandatory for Multi-Account Usage)**  
   If you're running multiple accounts, create a file named `proxy.txt` and add your proxies in this format:

   ```text
   http://username:password@ip:port
   ```

   > **Note:** Only HTTP and HTTPS proxies are supported.

6. **Run the Main Bot**  
   Start the bot with:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

### Auto Reff Installation

1. **Prepare Auto Reff Files**  
   Create a file named `query_reff.txt` with the following content:

   ```text
   EU6HOU|20
   ```

   Here, `EU6HOU` is your referral code and `20` is the number of accounts you want to generate.

2. **Run the Auto Reff Module**  
   After installing dependencies (see Main Bot step 3), run:

   ```bash
   python reff.py
   ```

   The module will generate new referral accounts and save their device IDs to `result_query.txt` in the format:

   ```text
   deviceid|guest
   ```

3. **Integrate Reff Accounts**  
   To run the generated reff accounts in the main bot, enable `"run_with_reff": true` in your `config.json`.
